# SoC Now
- This Mini SoC Generator will generate an System on Chip (SoC)
- It will be based on RISC-V ISA (IMFC extensions) (32-bit)
- It will take specifications of the SoC as parameters
- All the Modules will be parametrised and re-usable, for anyone who requires just a single part instead on an entire SoC
- High Level approaches will be used by using CHISEL (Constructing Hardware in Scala Embedded Language)
